# Sylla API

Sylla is a simple syllable based random name generator. Names are generated by taking a large list of English names, splitting them into syllables, and mixing them up. The resulting names range from obviously random, to surprisingly reasonable.

## API

The name generation is accessible via a simple api. The api is currently hosted on heroku: https://sylla-api.herokuapp.com/

### /names

Returns a variable number of names.

Allowed Methods: POST, GET

Params are as follows:
- numNames : number 
    The number of names to generate
- numSyllablesPerName : number
    The number of syllables per name to use when generating the names
- nameSeeds : str | list
    A list of names to use as seeds for generating the new name. If
    provided as a string it can be space or comma seperated.

GET requests should provide them as query params, POST as a json body.

#### Example

`curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"numSyllablesPerName": 4, "numNames": 10}'`
