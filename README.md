# Sylla API

Sylla is a simple syllable based random name generator. Names are generated by taking a large list of English names, splitting them into syllables, and mixing them up. The resulting names range from obviously random, to surprisingly reasonable.

## API

The name generation is accessible via a simple api. The api is currently hosted on heroku: https://sylla-api.herokuapp.com/

### /names

Allowed Methods: POST, GET

Returns a JSON array of randomly generated names, or 1 if a GET request. POST requests are expected to have JSON body with the following keys:

- **numNames** <number> : the number of names to return
- **numSyllablesPerName** <number> : the number of syllables to use per name

#### Example

`curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"numSyllablesPerName": 4, "numNames": 10}'`
